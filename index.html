                <div>
                    <p> Hello, my name is Alissa Lorberau and 
                        I reside in a small town just outside of Corpus Christi, TX 
                        with my family and I. My journey into tech first started when I had my 
                        twins. I just never wanted to leave their side and so I researched ways to 
                        work from home. I started with basic coding and slowly but surely I gained 
                        confidence in my abilities. I am now a front end developer.</p>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <p> Through tech I have satisfated my hunger for new horizons and a way to be 
                        home more with my family. Always have I been fascinated by the world of technology and
                        the endless possibilities it holds. I have a strong passion for learning and
                        growing, and I am always looking for new challenges to take on. I am excited
                        to share my skills and experiences with you and to see where this journey takes me.</p>
